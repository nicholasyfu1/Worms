Running Experiments
===================

This section will walk through the basics of running an experiment on the behavior box.

When the program is launched, it will display the main menu options. 
    * ``New Experiment`` starts a new experiment 
    * ``Data Menu`` navigates to data options including analysis, graphing, and deletion.
        See :doc:`analysis` for detailed instructions.
    * ``Preview Camera`` starts a camera preview window
    * ``Quit`` exits the program

.. note:: If the program does not launch, check that the camera ribbon cable is undamaged and properly seated.

Starting a new experiment
-------------------------

    #. To start a new experiment, select ``New Experiment`` from the main menu.
    #. Select the experiment type and click ``Next``. Or, to return to the main menu, click ``Back to Main Menu``.
    #. Enter the duration of your experiment (in seconds) and click ``Next``. To return to experiment type selection, click ``Back to Experiment Selection``.
    #. The program will display a confirmation page with the experiment number.
        You are advised to record this number in your lab notebook, because you will need it to analyze data later.
        If all the information is correct, click ``Next``. Or, use ``Back`` to return to the previous screen.
    #. Use the live preview to check that your worms are visible and the petri dish is centered in the camera view.
        Once you have placed the worms in the dish, click ``Next``. 
        To return to the confirmation page, click the ``Back to Confirm Page``.
        .. note:: For this step, please reference specific protocols for the type of experiment selected.
    #. To start the image capturing process, click ``Start``.
        .. note:: Once the experiment begins, it must run for the full duration and it cannot be stopped. 
            To return to the previous page, click ``Back to Insert Worms``.

        .. note:: While the experiment is running, the program will display a countdown, in seconds, of how much time is left in the experiment. 

Reviewing experiment images
---------------------------

    * Once the experiment is complete, click ``Continue to review this experimentâ€™s data`` to proceed.
        You will be directed to a page where you can review the data collected from the experiment. 
        Use the scroll bar to view different pictures. 
        The pictures are displayed in chronological order from top to bottom. 
        Select ``Keep`` to save the all of the images onto the SD card.
        Or if there was an issue with the experiment, select ``Discard`` to delete the images captured.

Next steps
----------

At this point, your images are safely stored on the RPi SD card. 
You can continue to run more experiments, and any future experiments will be saved into their own folder on the SD card.

See :doc:`analysis` to learn how to analyze your data.
