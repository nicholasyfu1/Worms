Getting Started
===============

The Behavior Box comes with a built in Raspberry Pi (RPi) to run programs
and a touch screen display to operate the RPi. 

.. note:: 
    The procedures in this section require that all setup be completed. 
    To install the Behavior Box software on a new RPi, see :doc:`troubleshooting`.
    
The box
-------

Make sure to familiarize yourself with the box before getting started with any experiments. 
The behavior box is divided into two parts: the top part houses all of the electronics, 
including the RPi and the camera. The bottom part is where all of the experiments will be run.

Starting the program
--------------------

Before starting, make sure the Behavior Box is placed on a stable, flat surface, and remove obstructions from the work area.

.. note:: The program is designed to be solely operated using the touchscreen.
    Alternatively, a keyboard and mouse can be used to improve accessibility.

#. Boot up the RPi by plugging the power adapter into an outlet. The RPi should automatically boot when plugged in.
#. To launch the program, double tap on the "Behavior Box" icon on the desktop. 
#. See :doc:`running` to learn how to get stated on your first experiment.
